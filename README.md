# Techscape

Since the website made using velo by wix. It has low code!!

## Inspiration

Accessibility is viewed as a major key to the success of their business. I wanted to build a solution that put opportunities and resources within reach to all communities which makes tech accessible for everyone. So, I built TechScape which is a one stop place for all techies.

## What it does

Here are the features of techscape:

Community: People who are eager to assist one another are drawn to the tech community. As a result, many entrepreneurs discover professionals to help them along the road in everything from marketing and sales to software development and legal issues simply by being a part of a community. Here you can find various communities to get involved.

Podcast: IT and tech podcasts can be a great way of introducing you to topics you're interested in, curious about, or have yet to learn. They might also help you in your job search as you learn new skills, keep up with trends, and get acquainted with the lingo of the IT world. Listen to several tech podcasts to expand your knowledge.

Opportunities: You can find opportunities to participate in hackathons and internships to boost your professional development.

Forum: A forum is an online discussion board where people can ask questions, share their experiences, and discuss topics of mutual interest. Forums are an excellent way to create social connections and a sense of community. They can also help you to cultivate an interest group about a particular subject.

Mentor: You can connect with various mentors who can solve your queries and guide you to the right path. 

## How we built it

I built this website using wix and javascript.

## Challenges we ran into

As my teammates were not responsive, I decided to work alone by myself. I felt challenged while choosing the template from wix as wix has more varieties of amazing templates to use and deciding the features was a difficult one.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I’m proud of how I was able to create a website using wix in such a short amount of time. In addition, since this was my first time working on a Wix project solo, it was really interesting to have full control over every aspect of the app, and I’m proud of what I’ve created!

## What we learned

One big thing I learned is how to better work with Wix. I’m still pretty new to using it, as it’s only my second time with it, and every time I work with it I learn something new!

## What's next for TechScape

The website will be expanded, allowing it to display opportunities, podcasts that are available in real time. And allow the companies to post job opportunities on the platform.
